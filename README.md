# Introduction:

Java is a popular, high-level programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s. It is an object-oriented programming language that was designed to be portable and platform-independent, meaning that Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, regardless of the underlying hardware or operating system.

## Learn about Java and its workings.

Java is widely used for developing desktop, web, mobile, and enterprise applications. Some of the key features of Java include:

### Object-Oriented:

> Java is an object-oriented programming language, which means that it is based on the concept of objects, classes, and inheritance. This makes it easier for developers to organize and maintain large, complex codebases.

### Platform-Independent:

> Java is designed to be platform-independent, so code written in Java can be run on any device that has a JVM installed, without having to recompile the code.

### Secure:

> Java is known for its security features, which make it a popular choice for developing enterprise applications. Java uses a combination of class loaders, bytecode verifiers, and security managers to ensure that code runs in a secure environment.

### Multithreaded:

> Java supports multithreading, which allows multiple threads of execution to run concurrently within a single program. This makes it possible to write highly concurrent and scalable applications in Java.

### Memory Management:

> Java includes an automatic memory management system that manages the allocation and deallocation of memory used by the program. This helps to prevent memory leaks and other common memory-related problems that can occur in other programming languages.

### Compilation and Execution:

> Java code is written in plain text files and saved with a .java file extension. When the code is ready to be run, it is compiled into bytecode using the javac compiler. The bytecode is then executed by the JVM, which converts it into machine-readable instructions that can be executed by the underlying hardware.
