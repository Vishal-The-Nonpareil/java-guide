# Output In Java:

```
System.out.print("Hello World");

```

### In code:

> **Function:** == print( )

> **Double coats** == " "

> **Parenthesis** == ( )

> **Semicolan** == **Statement Terminator** == ;

```
public class First {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("Hello Java Programmers");
    }

}

```

### Use for print on same line

1. **print**

```
System.out.print("Hello Java Programmers");
```

### Escape Sequences

Escape sequences in Java are a way to include special characters or characters that cannot be typed directly into a string. They are used to represent certain characters in a string, such as newline, tab, quote mark, etc. Here is an explanation of escape sequences in Java in a point-wise manner with examples:

Backslash character: The backslash () is used to indicate that the character following it has a special meaning. For example, if we want to include a double quote in a string, we can use the backslash to escape it.

2. **println**

```
System.out.print("Hello Java Programmers");
```

3. **\n**

```
System.out.print("Hello Java Programmers\n");
```

Example: String str = "He said, \"Hello world!\"";

Newline: The newline character (\n) is used to create a new line in the output. It is often used to separate lines of text.

Example: System.out.println("Hello\nworld");

Tab: The tab character (\t) is used to create a horizontal tab space in the output.

Example: System.out.println("Name:\tJohn");

Carriage return: The carriage return character (\r) is used to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.

Example: System.out.println("Loading...\r");

### Print Pattern:

```
public class Pattern {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.print("*****\n");
        System.out.print("****\n");
        System.out.println("***");
        System.out.println("**");
        System.out.println("*");
    }
}
```
