# Loops Questions:

## 1. How many times "Hello" is printed?

```
public class solution{
    public static void main(String args[]){

        for(int i = 0; i<5; i++){
            System.out.println("Hello");
            i +=2; // i = i+2
        }
    }
}
```

## 2. Write a program that reads a set of integers, and then prints the sum of the even and odd integers.

## 3. Write a program to find the factorial of any number entered by the user. (Hint: factorial of anumber n = n*(n-1)*(n-2)\*(n-3)\*......\*1 and exists for positive numbers only. We write factorial as n! So, factorial of 0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24 and so on.

Note - Please do not confuse factorial with NOT EQUAL TO operator, they are not the same)

## 4. Write a program to print the multiplication table of a number N, entered by the user.

## 5. What is wrong in the following program?

```
public class Solution5 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("i = " + i);
        }
    }

}
```
